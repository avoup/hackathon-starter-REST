Hackathon Starter REST
=======================

[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/avoup/hackathon-starter-rest/status.svg?style=flat)](https://david-dm.org/avoup/hackathon-starter-rest) [![devDependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/avoup/hackathon-starter-rest/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/avoup/hackathon-starter-rest?type=dev) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/avoup/hackathon-starter-rest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/avoup/hackathon-starter-rest)

Inspired by https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter


A boilerplate for **Node.js** REST api.

When starting a new project until you get to the best part of it you have to go through setting it up and adding all the necessary features like authentication with json web token, social authentication, deciding on json request/response format and the list goes on.

Goal of hackathon-starter-REST (HSR) is to skip through all this steps and get to the interesting part of a project quicker.

The code is as simple as it gets, it is thoroughly documented and can be easily changed to suit your needs.

Features
--------

- **Local Authentication**
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**
  - Google
  - more will be added...
- **Account Management**
  - Forgot password
  - Reset password
  - Verification via email using jwt (sendgrid)
  - Auth via jwt
- **JSON:API request/response structure**

**Note**: list is not exhaustive and more features will be added.

Prerequisites
-------------

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) *
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) *
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**Note**: required prerequisites are marked by *

Getting Started
---------------

In your terminal type:

```bash
# Clone from Github
git clone https://github.com/avoup/hackathon-starter-REST.git myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Start your app
# Regularly
npm start
# In development mode (starts nodemon)
npm run dev
```

API Keys
------------------

In order to use OAuth methods and APIs in the project, you will have to obtain credentials and set them as environment variables in .env file.

**Note:** The app will read environment variables from .env file not .env.example file. You can use.env.example file to set up your .env file.

- Visit <a href="https://cloud.google.com/console/project" target="_blank">Google Cloud Console</a>
- Click on the **Create Project** button
- Enter *Project Name*, then click on **Create** button
- Then click on *APIs & auth* in the sidebar and select *API* tab
- Click on **Google+ API** under *Social APIs*, then click **Enable API**
- Click on **Google Drive API** under *G Suite*, then click **Enable API**
- Click on **Google Sheets API** under *G Suite*, then click **Enable API**
- Next, under *APIs & auth* in the sidebar click on *Credentials* tab
- Click on **Create new Client ID** button
- Select *Web Application* and click on **Configure Consent Screen**
- Fill out the required fields then click on **Save**
- In the *Create Client ID* modal dialog:
 - **Application Type**: Web Application
 - **Authorized Javascript origins**: http://localhost:8080
 - **Authorized redirect URI**: http://localhost:8080/auth/google/callback
- Click on **Create Client ID** button
- Copy and paste *Client ID* and *Client secret* keys into `.env`

**Note:** When you ready to deploy to production don't forget to
add your new URL to *Authorized Javascript origins* and *Authorized redirect URI*,
e.g. `http://my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com` and
`http://my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com/auth/google/callback` respectively.
The same goes for other providers.

<img src="https://sendgrid.com/brand/sg-logo-300.png" width="200">

You can use SendGrid for sending emails.  The developer tier allows you to send 100 free emails per day.  As an Alternative to SendGrid, you may also choose to use an SMTP service provider.  If using SendGrid:
- Go to <a href="https://sendgrid.com/user/signup" target="_blank">https://sendgrid.com/user/signup</a>
- Sign up and **confirm** your account via the *activation email*
- Then enter your SendGrid *API Key* into `.env` file as SENDGRID_API_KEY

Deployment
----------

The app is easily deployable to any cloud or conventional hosting provider as it does not require any special permissions or prerequisites.

That said you might find these instructions helpful:

### Deployment to Heroku

<img src="https://www.fullstackpython.com/img/logos/heroku.png" width="200">

- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- In a terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials
- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`
- Use the command `heroku config:set KEY=val` to set the different environment variables (KEY=val) for your application (i.e.  `heroku config:set BASE_URL=[heroku App Name].herokuapp.com` or `heroku config:set MONGODB_URI=mongodb://dbuser:<password>@cluster0-shard-00-00-sdf32.mongodb.net:27017,cluster0-shard-00-01-sdf32.mongodb.net:27017/<dbname>?ssl=true&retryWrites=true&w=majority` (see Hosted MongoDB Atlas below), etc.)  Make sure to set the environment variables for SENDGRID_USER, SENDGRID_PASSWORD, and any other API that you are using as well.
- Lastly, do `git push heroku master`.

Please note that you may also use the [Herko Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com) to set or modify the configurations for your application.

### Hosted MongoDB Atlas

<img src="https://www.mongodb.com/assets/images/global/MongoDB_Logo_Dark.svg" width="200">

- Go to [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- Click the green **Get started free** button
- Fill in your information then hit **Get started free**
- You will be redirected to Create New Cluster page.
- Select a **Cloud Provider and Region** (such as AWS and a free tier region)
- Select cluster Tier to Free forever **Shared** Cluster
- Give Cluster a name (default: Cluster0)
- Click on green **:zap:Create Cluster button**
- Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user. To create a new MongoDB user, from the **Clusters view**, select the **Security tab**
- Under the **MongoDB Users** tab, click on **+Add New User**
- Fill in a username and password and give it either **Atlas Admin** User Privilege
- Next, you will need to create an IP address whitelist and obtain the connection URI.  In the Clusters view, under the cluster details (i.e. SANDBOX - Cluster0), click on the **CONNECT** button.
- Under section **(1) Check the IP Whitelist**, click on **ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE**. The form will add a field with `0.0.0.0/0`.  Click **SAVE** to save the `0.0.0.0/0` whitelist.
- Under section **(2) Choose a connection method**, click on **Connect Your Application**
- In the new screen, select **Node.js** as Driver and version **3.6 or later**.
- Finally, copy the URI connection string and replace the URI in MONGODB_URI of `.env.example` with this URI string.  Make sure to replace the <PASSWORD> with the db User password that you created under the Security tab.
- Note that after some of the steps in the Atlas UI, you may see a banner stating `We are deploying your changes`.  You will need to wait for the deployment to finish before using the DB in your application.


**Note:** As an alternative to MongoDB Atlas, there is also [Compose](https://www.compose.io/).
